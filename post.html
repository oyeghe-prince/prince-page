      <h3>
        `Highlight of our contents in my teaching website coded personally by
        Your's truly
      </h3>

      <p>
        around the world there are over 1000 web developers and according to the
        law of demand and supply when the supply is higher in relative to the
        demand the price deteriotate so in order to stand out and be the best in
        order to be able to earn an incredilbly large amount of money by either
        coding of websites for big firms or teaching eager students who want to
        learn how to code an website
      </p>

      <h4>
        please note that websites are created to help others acquire information
        and resources on the internet so on that case please if you are reading
        this and your initial motive for coming into this website was to create
        an website where either bad occurences will be supported or to code an
        illegal web please skip this website THANKS
      </h4>

      <p>
        Many website developing online tutorials are really boring as they only
        teach you without putting your fun and happiness in mind so why do they
        say that code is fun to learn.But in my online class we shall make
        coding very fun,interactive and easy to learn
      </p>

      <h3>For Parents Reading This</h3>
      <p>
        If you intend on Signing up your ward to my web development class please
        click on the button above and let your ward get a proper and well
        deserved knownledge of website development because in this country and
        in this economy we all can agree that we do not know the outcome of
        tommorrow and you do not know if your ward may use this web development
        to make his/her first millions because an average website sold to an
        firm can be sold at a price of Â£4500 or $10400 depending on the
        magnitude and usefullness of the website created
